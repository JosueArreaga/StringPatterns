# StringPatterns
This project generates a random String with a length of up to 1 Billion Characters. It then looks for substrings that are either Singletons, Positively Arithmetic, 
Negatively Arithmetic, Balanced Tripartite, Balanced Bipartite, or Palindromes. It then returns the longest-most-interesting string pattern. We define the most 
interesting to be the rarest statistical type. Singletons are the rarest in our program, and rarity decreases to Palindromes (the most common).
